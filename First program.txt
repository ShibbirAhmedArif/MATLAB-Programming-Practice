Ex. 1 Write your first Matlab program

a = 7;
b = 5;
c = a+b

Output:
12

Note: 

(1) At the end of a statement, The semicolon acts to suppress output i.e. to keep the program running in a quiet mode. 

(2) The third statement, c = a+b, is not followed by a semicolon so that the content of the variable c is "dumped" as the output.
