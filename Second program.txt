Ex. 2 The meaning of "a = b"

In Matlab and in any programming language, the statement "a = b" does not mean
"a equals b". Instead, it prompts the action of replacing the content of a by the
content of b.

a = 3;
b = a;
b

Output:
3

Note:

1. Think of the two "variables" a and b as two buckets labeled "a" and "b". 

2. The first statement puts the number 3 into bucket a. 

3. The second statement puts the content of bucket a into bucket b, such that we now have "3" in bucket b. 
   (The content of bucket a remains unchanged after this action.) 

4. The third statement dumps the content of bucket b so the final output is "3".
